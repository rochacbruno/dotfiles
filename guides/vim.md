## Plugins

- `:DB` - manage databases
- `:DBUI` - manage databases in a buffer ui
- `:Clap` - Preview and search and preview colorscheme
- `:Leaders` - Show all leader mappings
- `:Bufferize` - Run a command and send output to a buffer
- `:Dispatch` - Run command in BG
- `:Black` - Format python code

* File System Changes
  * `:Delete`: Delete a buffer and the file on disk simultaneously.
  * `:Unlink`: Like `:Delete`, but keeps the now empty buffer.
  * `:Move`: Rename a buffer and the file on disk simultaneously.
  * `:Rename`: Like `:Move`, but relative to the current file's containing directory.
  * `:Chmod`: Change the permissions of the current file.
  * `:Mkdir`: Create a directory, defaulting to the parent of the current file.
  * `:Cfind`: Run `find` and load the results into the quickfix list.
  * `:Clocate`: Run `locate` and load the results into the quickfix list.
  * `:Lfind`/`:Llocate`: Like above, but use the location list.
  * `:Wall`: Write every open window.  Handy for kicking off tools like [guard][].
  * `:SudoWrite`: Write a privileged file with `sudo`.
  * `:SudoEdit`: Edit a privileged file with `sudo`.
  * File type detection for `sudo -e` is based on original file name.
  * New files created with a shebang line are automatically made executable.

## Tricks


### Sort

- Select lines in visual mode or use `%` for whole file
- `:sort` Sort Alphabetically
- `:sort!` Reverse order
- `:sort u` Remove duplicates
- `:sort n` Numeric wise sorting

### Removing sourrounding brackets w/o plugin

Having:

```python
{
  "foo": 1,
  "bar": 2,
}
```

Place the cursor inside the {} and type in normal mode: `di{va{p`

- `di{` cuts everything inside the brackets
- `va{` selects the empty brackets
- `p` replaces it with previously cut content


### Macro

qa record your actions in the register a.
Then @a will replay the macro saved into the register a
as if you typed it. @@ is a shortcut to replay the last executed macro.

#### Example

On a line containing only the number 1, type this:

- `qaYp<C-a>q` â†’
  - qa start recording.
  - Yp duplicate this line.
  - `<C-a>` increment the number.
  - q stop recording.
- @a â†’ write 2 under the 1
- @@ â†’ write 3 under the 2
- Now do 100@@ will create a list of increasing numbers until 103.
